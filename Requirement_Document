How will the delivery boy be able to get the information about the product to be delivered? Do we need one more user to added into user of system list.
What should be the product selection strategy while displaying the product list to user from multiple shopkeepers.
what are the different order status that each order will go through in his life cycle?
Do you want to show them the list of shopkeepers to him they are placing the order? or it will be invisible and you will pick up the product, if yes, then how will you quote the best rate for the product.
will seller hub need to take some kind of government licenses like Shopkeeper need to take while registering with us?
How will the distance of Customer's current location and Shop location be determined?
What will be the behavior of system if user logs in with the same user id but on different device.
What will be the mechanism used for detecting the different device.
How will the product image download mechanism will work? Device will send all the SKUID of the product for which images are needed. Server will put all the required images in a zip file and send it to device. Device will unzip it, and will update the ProductImages table and will store the images in database.
Any propsoed mechanism for enquiring about the product which is not listed but customer feels that it may be available from shopkeeper.
Possible complaint categories while filing a complaint against a shopid for a order id ?
We need to define two type of categories, one for showing before shop selction. i.e. Shop Category and another after selcting the shop i.e. Product category. Please define initial values for both.
How will we determine the serviceable area for a Shop, on the basis of Customer's and Shop's Map locations or on the basis of Specifically specified service area by shopkeeper
Multilple shops means multiple orders ? Y/N
Business rule for displaying the Product category screen or not? there may be the case when shop is having very few products to be displayed.
Product price and effective price columns needs to be differentiated in Products table

Different product selection strategy are
1- Lowest priced first
2- Highest ranking first
3- Nearest first

Which are the possible categories for the products to be displayed.
How are we supposed to do the screen navigation at the customer end.
1- Launch the application
2- Customer will be presented with all the possible categories
3- As soon as customer will click on a category, he will be presented with all the products in that category, product information will be showing seller information as well something similar to flipkart and customer can see all the sellers with their quoted price for that product. The first highlighted product displayed will depend on the product selection strategy used.
In that case, it will be tough to maintain the min order policy from the shopkeeper's point of view. Because an order of 10 products may contain 5 sellers.
OR
As soon as customer will click on Category, he will be presented with all the sellers of that category and clicking on seller will display the products offered by him. Product will be displayed with all the required information and customer can see all the sellers with their quoted price for that product.
