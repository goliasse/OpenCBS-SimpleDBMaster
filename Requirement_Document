Each application will be regsitered with an application ID which will be allocated to each shopkeeper and Seller hub.
If that ID is active then only application will be active otherwise appication will not be active.
Customer can get the application link by giving a missed call on a specific mobile number and that mobile number may be owned by shopkeeper.
We need to create a separate application for this purpose which will send the link to customer number and put that number into verfied mobile number database. When customer will use that mobile number for registration, he will be able to do it straightly, no need to verify the mobile number.
Customer's mobile number will be used a his unique ID
Products will be categorised into different categories
Each product will be having a unique ID
While placing the order, customer will provide maximum acceptable date and time

A screen will be displayed to him asking for the mobile number

If his mobile number is not in verified mobile number list then he will be asked to give a miss call on the specified mobile number. Once he gives the miss call, mobile number will be checked again, if it is verfied he can register himself.
