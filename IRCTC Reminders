IRCTC Reminders

An app which reminds you of your IRCTC bookings

For the frequent travellers, it is very tough task to track your bookings on SMS and Emails. As there would be multiple trains, multiple routes and multiple tickets to be remembered. So this application gets you some relief of this hectic task.

What 'IRCTC Reminders' does:-
Step 1- It will capture the IRCTC SMS automatically from the phone. 
Users also have the some other options as well
1- Copy and paste the SMS manually
2- Sync the Inbox SMS
3- Feed the required data

Step 2 - Application will parse the SMS and populate the fields
Step 3 - After review you can add the journey and set the reminders
Step 4 - Now it is application's responsibility to send the reminders as per the specification.

Initially we are planning to send the reminders through two mediums i.e. Emails and Push Notifications. 
Later on we will be adding some more mediums.

Note - This application requires an internet connection to work.
