quality, based on the participation of all members of the organization and aiming at longterm
success through customer satisfaction, and benefits to all members of the organization
and to society. Total Quality Management consists of planning, organizing, directing,
control, and assurance. [After ISO 8402]
(EITP) (ATM) TPI Next~ A continuous business-driven framework for test process improvement that
describes the key elements of an effective and efficient test process.
(EITP) TPG~ See Test Process Group.
(EITP) TQM~ See Total Quality Management.
(F) traceability~ The ability to identify related items in documentation and software, such as
requirements with associated tests. See also horizontal traceability, vertical traceability.
(EITP) transactional analysis~ The analysis of transactions between people and within people’s
minds; a transaction is defined as a stimulus plus a response. Transactions take place
between people and between the ego states (personality segments) within one person’s
mind.
(EITP) transcendent-based quality~ A view of quality, wherein quality cannot be precisely defined,
but we know it when we see it, or are aware of its absence when it is missing. Quality
depends on the perception and affective feelings of an individual or group of individuals
towards a product. [After Garvin] See also manufacturing-based quality, product-based
quality, user-based quality, value-based quality.
(ATA) understandability~ The capability of the software product to enable the user to understand
whether the software is suitable, and how it can be used for particular tasks and conditions of
use. [ISO 9126] See also usability.
unit~ See component. 49
(F) unit test framework~ A tool that provides an environment for unit or component testing in
which a component can be tested in isolation or with suitable stubs and drivers. It also
provides other support for the developer, such as debugging capabilities. [Graham]
unit testing~ See component testing.
unreachable code~ Code that cannot be reached and therefore is impossible to execute.
usability~ The capability of the software to be understood, learned, used and attractive to the
user when used under specified conditions. [ISO 9126]
(ATA) (F) usability testing~ Testing to determine the extent to which the software product is
understood, easy to learn, easy to operate and attractive to the users under specified conditions. [After ISO 9126]

use case~ A sequence of transactions in a dialogue between an actor and a component or system with a tangible result, where an actor can be a user or anything that can exchange information with the system.

(ATA) (F) use case testing~ A black box test design technique in which test cases are designed to execute scenarios of use cases.

(F) user acceptance testing~ See acceptance testing.

(EITP) user-based quality~ A view of quality, wherein quality is the capacity to satisfy needs, wants and desires of the user(s). A product or service that does not fulfill user needs is unlikely to find any users. This is a context dependent, contingent approach to quality since different business characteristics require different qualities of a product. [after Garvin] See also manufacturing-based quality, product-based quality, transcendent-based quality, value based quality.

user scenario testing~ See use case testing

user story~ A high-level user or business requirement commonly used in agile software development, typically consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language capturing what functionality a user needs, any non-functional criteria, and also includes acceptance criteria. See also agile software development, requirement.

(ATA) user story testing~ A black box test design technique in which test cases are designed based on user stories to verify their correct implementation. See also user story.

user test~ A test whereby real-life users are involved to evaluate the usability of a component or system.

(F) V-model~ A framework to describe the software development lifecycle activities from requirements specification to maintenance. The V-model illustrates how testing activities can be integrated into each phase of the software development lifecycle.

(F) validation~ Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled. [ISO 9000]

(EITP) value-based quality~ A view of quality, wherein quality is defined by price. A quality product or service is one that provides desired performance at an acceptable cost. Quality is determined by means of a decision process with stakeholders on trade-offs between time, effort and cost aspects. [After Garvin] See also manufacturing-based quality, productbased quality, transcendent-based quality, user-based quality.50

variable~ An element of storage in a computer that is accessible by a software program by referring to it by a name.

(F) verification~ Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled. [ISO 9000]

(F) version control~ See configuration control.

vertical traceability~ The tracing of requirements through the layers of development documentation to components.

volume testing~ Testing where the system is subjected to large volumes of data. See also resource-utilization testing.

(ATM) (F) walkthrough~ A step-by-step presentation by the author of a document in order to gather information and to establish a common understanding of its content.[Freedman and Weinberg, IEEE 1028] See also peer review.

(ATA) WAMMI~ See Website Analysis and MeasureMent Inventory.

 WBS~ See Work Breakdown Structure.

(ATA) Website Analysis and MeasureMent Inventory (WAMMI)~ A questionnaire-based usability test technique for measuring web site software quality from the end user's point of view.

white-box technique~ See white-box test design technique.

(ATT) (F) white-box test design technique~ Procedure to derive and/or select test cases based on an analysis of the internal structure of a component or system.

(F) white-box testing~ Testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of the component or system.
(ATM) Wide Band Delphi~ An expert based test estimation technique that aims at making an accurate estimation using the collective wisdom of the team members.

(ATT) wild pointer~ A pointer that references a location that is out of scope for that pointer or that does not exist. See also pointer.

Work Breakdown Structure~ An arrangement of work elements and their relationship to each other and to the end product. [CMMI]
